Curt started cartooning as a kid...and never stopped. In high school his work appeared weekly in a motocross newspaper, Southern California Motocross. This led to illustrating for several extreme sport magazines : Motocross Action, H30 Hawaiian Heavywater, Mountain Biking, and Bicycle Retailer.

His drawings have appeared on websites, decals, T-shirts, and even an entire bus. He’s illustrated five books, and is currently writing and doing the art for his own kid’s book.

He graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara with a degree in Studio Art.

For a career he's worked in the screen printing industry making and designing shirts, signs, stickers, and logos.

Curt has taught cartooning classes to all ages and volunteered  in local schools. His best advice to students - don’t worry about what anyone else thinks of your work. Make it crazy because it's a cartoon. And…never stop drawing.

Ashland, Oregon has been his home since 1995.
