Yes I do custom cartoons! Commissions are a big part of our business. It can be you on your dirt bike, or your mini rider. We also do art for events, races, shops, clubs, websites, t-shirt designs, and logos. And it doesn't have to be motorcycles, it can be whatever you can imagine. Planes, trains or automobiles. Animals and school mascots - you name it. Even clowns.

For basic motocross cartoons the starting rate is $200. The process is you send me some photos of you riding, give me the year, make and model of your bike and what gear you wear. I start off doing a pencil sketch for you to look at.  This is the stage where I make revisions or changes if needed. Once you approve that, I will draw it all in ink. Then I scan it and color it. In the end, I give you electronic files including vector art, which is what printers want. Plus jpeg files you can use like photos.

Depending on how busy I am, the whole process is usually 10 days or less.

Hereâ€™s the fine print:
* All artwork Copyright - Curt Evans.
* May be used for personal use only.
* All artwork remains the property of the artist.

I also do cartoons for commercial usage, for T-shirts, branding, promotions, logos, and websites. Of course, there is a different pricing structure. For a quote just email me (in "Contacts") and tell me what you're thinking. I've worked with all types of industries and organizations. Visit any of my social sites to see examples of my work to see if we'll make a good fit.
